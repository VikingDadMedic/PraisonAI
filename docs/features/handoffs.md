# Agent Handoffs

Agent handoffs enable seamless task delegation between specialised agents, allowing you to build sophisticated multi-agent systems where each agent focuses on its area of expertise.

## Overview

Handoffs in PraisonAI allow agents to transfer control to other agents based on the conversation context. This pattern is particularly useful for:
- Customer service routing
- Specialised task delegation
- Complex workflow orchestration
- Escalation scenarios

## How Handoffs Work

When you specify handoffs for an agent, PraisonAI automatically:
1. Converts each handoff into a tool that the agent can use
2. Adds instructions to the agent's prompt about available handoffs
3. Passes the full conversation history when transferring control

## Basic Usage

### Simple Handoff

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Create specialised agents

billing_agent = Agent(
 name="Billing",
 role="Billing specialist",
 goal="Handle billing inquiries and process payments",
 backstory="Expert in billing systems and payment processing"
)

refund_agent = Agent(
 name="Refunds",
 role="Refund specialist",
 goal="Process refund requests",
 backstory="Specialist in refund policies and processing"
)

# Create triage agent with handoffs

triage_agent = Agent(
 name="Triage",
 role="Customer service triage",
 goal="Route customer inquiries to the right specialist",
 backstory="Expert at understanding customer needs",
 handoffs=[billing_agent, refund_agent]
)

# The triage agent can now transfer to billing or refund agents

response = triage_agent.chat("I need a refund for my order")
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Callbacks

Execute custom code when handoffs occur:

```python
def log_handoff(from_agent, to_agent, context):
 print(f"Transferring from {from_agent.name} to {to_agent.name}")
 # Log to monitoring system, send notifications, etc.

from praisonaiagents import handoff

handoff_config = handoff(
 agent=billing_agent,
 on_handoff=log_handoff
)

triage_agent = Agent(
 name="Triage",
 handoffs=[handoff_config]
)
```

### Structured Input

Use Pydantic models to pass typed data during handoffs:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CustomerContext(BaseModel):
 customer_id: str
 order_id: str
 issue_type: str
 priority: str

handoff_config = handoff(
 agent=billing_agent,
 input_model=CustomerContext
)
```

### Input Filters

Control what conversation history is passed to the target agent:

```python
handoff_config = handoff(
 agent=technical_agent,

)
```

### Custom Tool Names

Override the default handoff tool name and description:

```python
handoff_config = handoff(
 agent=escalation_agent,
 name="escalate_to_manager",
 description="Escalate complex issues to a manager for resolution"
)
```

## Complete Example

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, handoff
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define context model

class CustomerInfo(BaseModel):
 name: str
 account_id: str
 issue_description: str

# Create specialised agents

billing_agent = Agent(
 name="BillingExpert",
 role="Billing specialist",
 goal="Resolve billing issues",
 backstory="10 years experience in billing",
 tools=[check_balance, process_payment]
)

technical_agent = Agent(
 name="TechSupport",
 role="Technical support",
 goal="Solve technical problems",
 backstory="Expert in troubleshooting",
 tools=[check_logs, restart_service]
)

manager_agent = Agent(
 name="Manager",
 role="Customer service manager",
 goal="Handle escalations",
 backstory="Experienced in conflict resolution"
)

# Configure handoffs with advanced features

handoffs = [
 # Simple handoff

 billing_agent,

 # Handoff with callback

 handoff(
 agent=technical_agent,
 on_handoff=lambda f, t, c: log_transfer(f.name, t.name)
 ),

 # Handoff with structured input and filters

 handoff(
 agent=manager_agent,
 name="escalate_to_management",
 description="Escalate serious issues to management",
 input_model=CustomerInfo,

 )
]

# Create main agent with handoffs

support_agent = Agent(
 name="Support",
 role="Customer support",
 goal="Help customers with their issues",
 backstory="First point of contact",
 handoffs=handoffs
)

# Use in conversation

result = support_agent.chat("My payment failed and now I can't access my account")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Agent Responsibilities**: Each agent should have a well-defined role and expertise area
2. **Minimal Context**: Use filters to pass only relevant conversation history
3. **Structured Data**: Use Pydantic models for complex handoff scenarios
4. **Monitoring**: Implement callbacks to track handoff patterns
5. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Always have a path for unhandled scenarios

## Implementation Details

Under the hood, handoffs are converted to tools:

```python
# This handoff configuration:

agent.handoffs = [billing_agent]

# Becomes a tool like:

{
 "name": "transfer_to_billing",
 "description": "Transfer conversation to Billing agent: Billing specialist...",
 "function":
}
```

The agent's prompt is also updated to include handoff instructions, making the agent aware of when and how to delegate tasks.

## Common Patterns

### Customer Service Router

```python
# Specialised agents for different departments

agents = {
 "billing": billing_agent,
 "technical": technical_agent,
 "sales": sales_agent,
 "refunds": refund_agent
}

router = Agent(
 name="Router",
 handoffs=list(agents.values())
)
```

### Escalation Chain

```python
level1 = Agent(name="L1Support", handoffs=[level2])
level2 = Agent(name="L2Support", handoffs=[level3])
level3 = Agent(name="L3Support", handoffs=[manager])
```

### Skill-based Routing

```python
# Agents with specific skills

python_expert = Agent(name="PythonExpert", ...)
javascript_expert = Agent(name="JSExpert", ...)
database_expert = Agent(name="DBExpert", ...)

tech_lead = Agent(
 name="TechLead",
 handoffs=[python_expert, javascript_expert, database_expert]
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Handoff Not Triggering

* Ensure the agent's LLM supports tool calling
* Check that handoff agents are properly configured
* Verify the conversation context clearly indicates need for transfer

### Context Loss

* Use input filters to preserve important context
* Consider using structured input models
* Implement callbacks to track what information is passed

### Circular Handoffs

* Design clear handoff hierarchies
* Implement logic to prevent infinite loops
* Use callbacks to detect circular patterns
