# Adding Tools to Agents

In this lesson, we'll learn how to enhance your agents by adding tools. Tools allow agents to perform specific actions beyond just generating text, making them much more useful for real-world tasks.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:
- What agent tools are and why they're useful
- How to create simple tools for your agents
- How to integrate tools with your agents
- Best practices for tool design

## Understanding Agent Tools

Tools give your agents the ability to:
- Perform calculations
- Access specific information
- Interact with external systems
- Generate different types of content

## Creating Custom Tool

## When Does the Agent Use Tools?

The agent decides when to use tools based on:
1. The nature of the user's request
2. The tools available to it
3. The instructions you've provided

If your agent isn't using tools when expected, you might need to:
- Make your instructions more explicit about when to use tools
- Provide more descriptive tool definitions
- Ensure the tools are appropriate for the task

## Tool Best Practices

## Real-World Tool Examples

In production systems, you might create tools for:

## Advanced Tool Concepts

As you become more comfortable with tools, you can explore:
- Tools that call other tools
- Tools with complex parameters
- Tools that maintain state
- Dynamically generated tools

In the next lesson, we'll explore how to create a multi-agent system for more complex tasks.
