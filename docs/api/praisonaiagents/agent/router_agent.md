# RouterAgent

The `RouterAgent` class is an intelligent agent that automatically selects the most appropriate LLM model for each task based on various factors like task complexity, required capabilities, cost optimization, and performance requirements.

## Overview

`RouterAgent` extends the base `Agent` class and adds sophisticated model routing capabilities. It analyzes incoming tasks and dynamically chooses the best model from a configured set of options, optimizing for cost, performance, or specific capabilities as needed.

## Basic Usage

```python
from praisonaiagents import RouterAgent

# Create a router agent with multiple models

router = RouterAgent(
 role="Intelligent Assistant",
 goal="Provide optimal responses using the best model for each task",
 backstory="You are an adaptive AI that selects the perfect model for every situation.",
 models=["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "deepseek-chat"],
 routing_strategy="auto" # Automatic model selection

)

# The agent will automatically choose the best model

result = router.chat("Explain quantum computing") # Might use GPT-4 for complex topics

result = router.chat("What's 2+2?") # Might use GPT-4-mini for simple queries

```

## Configuration Options

### Core Parameters

- **models** (list[str]): List of available models to route between
- **routing_strategy** (str): Strategy for model selection
- `"auto"`: Automatic selection based on task analysis
- `"manual"`: User specifies model per request
- `"cost-optimized"`: Prioritize cheaper models when possible
- `"performance-optimized"`: Always use the best performing model
- **fallback_model** (str): Model to use if primary selection fails
- **model_capabilities** (dict): Custom capability definitions for models
- **cost_threshold** (float): Maximum cost per request (for cost-optimized strategy)
- **performance_metrics** (dict): Custom performance metrics for models

### Inherited Parameters

All parameters from the base `Agent` class are also available.

## Routing Strategies

### Automatic Routing

```python
# Automatic routing based on task complexity

router = RouterAgent(
 role="Smart Assistant",
 models=["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"],
 routing_strategy="auto"
)

# Complex task - likely routes to GPT-4 or Claude

complex_result = router.chat(
 "Analyze this code for security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements"
)

# Simple task - likely routes to GPT-4-mini

simple_result = router.chat("Format this date: 2024-01-15")
```

### Cost-Optimized Routing

```python
# Prioritize cost-effective models

budget_router = RouterAgent(
 role="Cost-Conscious Assistant",
 models=["gpt-4o-mini", "deepseek-chat", "gpt-4o"],
 routing_strategy="cost-optimized",
 cost_threshold=0.01 # Maximum $0.01 per request

)

# Will use the cheapest model that can handle the task

result = budget_router.chat("Summarize this article: ...")
```

### Performance-Optimized Routing

```python
# Always use the best model

performance_router = RouterAgent(
 role="High-Performance Assistant",
 models=["gpt-4o", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "gpt-4o-mini"],
 routing_strategy="performance-optimized"
)

# Will use the highest-performing model regardless of cost

result = performance_router.chat("Generate a complex business strategy")
```

### Manual Routing

```python
# User controls model selection

manual_router = RouterAgent(
 role="Configurable Assistant",
 models=["gpt-4o", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", "deepseek-chat"],
 routing_strategy="manual"
)

# Specify model explicitly

# Note: Manual model selection is handled through routing_strategy

# The actual model selection happens based on task analysis

result = manual_router.chat(
 "Translate this to French"
 # Model will be selected based on manual routing logic

)
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Model Capabilities

```python
# Define custom capabilities for routing decisions

router = RouterAgent(
 role="Capability-Aware Assistant",
 models=["gpt-4o", "gpt-4-vision-preview", "deepseek-chat"],

)

# Router will select based on required capabilities

code_result = router.chat("Debug this Python code") # Might choose deepseek-chat

image_result = router.chat("Analyze this image", images=["photo.jpg"]) # Will choose gpt-4-vision-preview

```

### Usage Tracking and Reporting

```python
# Track model usage and costs

router = RouterAgent(
 role="Tracked Assistant",
 models=["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"]
 # Usage tracking is built-in, no need for a parameter

)

# Use the router

for i in range(10):
 router.chat(f"Task {i}")

# Get usage report

usage_report = router.get_usage_report()
print(f"Total cost: ${usage_report['total_cost']}")
print(f"Model usage: {usage_report['model_usage']}")
```

### Fallback Handling

```python
# Configure fallback behavior

router = RouterAgent(
 role="Resilient Assistant",
 models=["gpt-4o", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"],
 fallback_model="gpt-4o-mini"
 # Retry behavior is handled by the base Agent class

)

# If primary models fail, falls back to gpt-4o-mini

result = router.chat("Process this request")
```

## Integration with Other Agents

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, RouterAgent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

# Create specialized router

router = RouterAgent(
 role="Task Router",
 goal="Route tasks to the optimal model",
 models=["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"]
)

# Create task handler

handler = Agent(
 role="Task Handler",
 goal="Process routed tasks"
)

# Create workflow

task1 = Task(
 description="Analyze complexity and route appropriately",
 agent=router
)

task2 = Task(
 description="Process the routed result",
 agent=handler,
 context=[task1]
)

# Execute workflow

agents = PraisonAIAgents(
 agents=[router, handler],
 tasks=[task1, task2]
)
agents.start()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**: Choose models that complement each other:
 ```python
 # Good mix: powerful + efficient + specialized

 models = ["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"]
 ```
2. **Strategy Selection**:
- Use `"auto"` for general-purpose applications
- Use `"cost-optimized"` for high-volume, budget-conscious apps
- Use `"performance-optimized"` for critical applications
- Use `"manual"` when you need explicit control
3. **Capability Definition**: Define clear capabilities for better routing:
 ```python
 model_capabilities = {
 "gpt-4o": ["complex-reasoning", "coding", "creative-writing"],
 "gpt-4o-mini": ["simple-tasks", "quick-responses", "basic-qa"],
 "deepseek-chat": ["coding", "technical", "debugging"]
 }
 ```
4. **Monitoring**: Usage is automatically tracked:
 ```python
 router = RouterAgent(
 models=["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini"]
 )
 # Get usage report anytime

 usage = router.get_usage_report()
 ```

## Performance Considerations

- Initial task analysis adds 0.1-0.5s overhead
- Model switching has minimal latency impact
- Usage tracking adds ~1% memory overhead
- Capability matching is O(n) where n is number of models
