# ImageAgent

The `ImageAgent` class is a specialized agent designed for AI image generation tasks. It extends the base `Agent` class and provides seamless integration with various image generation models and providers.

## Overview

`ImageAgent` simplifies the process of generating images using AI models by providing a unified interface for multiple image generation providers including OpenAI DALL-E, Stability AI, and other compatible models through the litellm library.

## Basic Usage

```python
from praisonaiagents import ImageAgent

# Create an image generation agent

artist = ImageAgent(
 role="Digital Artist",
 goal="Create stunning AI-generated artwork based on prompts",
 backstory="You are a creative AI artist capable of generating beautiful images.",
 llm="dall-e-3" # or other supported models

)

# Generate an image

result = artist.chat("Create a serene landscape with mountains at sunset")
print(result) # Returns the generated image URL or base64 data

```

## Configuration Options

### Core Parameters

- **llm** (str): The image generation model to use (e.g., "dall-e-3", "dall-e-2", "stable-diffusion-v1-6-0")
- **api_key** (str, optional): API key for the image generation service
- **style** (str, optional): Style of the generated image (default: "natural"). Note: This is passed to the underlying generation config
- **response_format** (str, optional): Format for the response ("url" or "b64_json", default: "url")
- **timeout** (int, optional): Timeout for image generation requests in seconds (default: 600)
- **api_version** (str, optional): Optional API version (required for Azure dall-e-3)

### Inherited Parameters

All parameters from the base `Agent` class are also available:
- **role**, **goal**, **backstory**, **instructions**
- **tools**, **llm**, **max_iter**, **max_retry**
- **verbose**, **cache**, **markdown**

## Supported Models

ImageAgent supports various image generation models through litellm:
- **OpenAI**: dall-e-3, dall-e-2
- **Stability AI**: stable-diffusion-v1-6-0, stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0
- **Other providers**: Any model supported by litellm's image generation capabilities

## Advanced Features

### Custom Styling

```python
# Create an agent with specific style preferences

artist = ImageAgent(
 role="Style-specific Artist",
 goal="Generate images in specific artistic styles",
 llm="dall-e-3",
 style="vivid", # or "natural" for DALL-E 3

 response_format="url"
)
```

### Async Image Generation

```python
import asyncio

artist = ImageAgent(
 role="Async Artist",
 goal="Generate images asynchronously",
 llm="dall-e-3"
)

async def generate_images():
 # Generate multiple images concurrently

 tasks = [
 artist.achat("A futuristic city"),
 artist.achat("An underwater palace"),
 artist.achat("A magical forest")
 ]
 results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
 return results

# Run async generation

images = asyncio.run(generate_images())
```

### Integration with Other Agents

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, ImageAgent

# Create a writer agent

writer = Agent(
 role="Creative Writer",
 goal="Write creative descriptions for image generation",
 backstory="You excel at crafting detailed, imaginative prompts."
)

# Create an image agent

artist = ImageAgent(
 role="AI Artist",
 goal="Transform written descriptions into stunning visuals",
 llm="dall-e-3"
)

# Writer creates a prompt

prompt = writer.chat("Write a detailed description of a dreamlike fantasy landscape")

# Artist generates the image

image = artist.chat(prompt)
```

## Error Handling

```python
from praisonaiagents import ImageAgent

artist = ImageAgent(
 llm="dall-e-3",
 max_retry=3, # Retry failed generations

 timeout=60 # 60 second timeout

)

try:
 result = artist.chat("Generate an image")
except Exception as e:
 print(f"Image generation failed: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model based on your needs:
- `dall-e-3`: Best quality and prompt adherence
- `dall-e-2`: Faster and more cost-effective
- Stable Diffusion variants: Open-source alternatives
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Provide detailed, descriptive prompts for better results:
 ```python
 # Good prompt

 "A serene Japanese garden with cherry blossoms, koi pond, and traditional bridge at sunset"

 # Less effective prompt

 "A garden"
 ```
3. **Response Format**: Use URL format for web applications, base64 for direct processing:
 ```python
 # For web display

 artist = ImageAgent(llm="dall-e-3", response_format="url")

 # For image processing

 artist = ImageAgent(llm="dall-e-3", response_format="b64_json")
 ```
4. **API Key Management**: Store API keys securely using environment variables:
 ```python
 import os

 artist = ImageAgent(
 llm="dall-e-3",
 api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
 )
 ```

## Limitations

- Image generation can be slow (10-30 seconds depending on the model)
- Some models have content policy restrictions
- Generation costs vary by model and provider
- Output resolution depends on the model capabilities
