# Create Custom Tools

## Step 1: Install the `praisonai` Package

First, you need to install the `praisonai` package. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install praisonai
```

## Step 2: Create the `InternetSearchTool`

Next, create a file named `tools.py` and add the following code to define the `InternetSearchTool`:

```python
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS
from praisonai_tools import BaseTool

class InternetSearchTool(BaseTool):
 name: str = "Internet Search Tool"
 description: str = "Search Internet for relevant information based on a query or latest news"

 def _run(self, query: str):
 ddgs = DDGS()
 results = ddgs.text(keywords=query, region='wt-wt', safesearch='moderate', max_results=5)
 return results
```

## Step 3: Define the Agent Configuration

Create a file named `agents.yaml` and add the following content to configure the agent:

```yaml
framework: crewai
topic: research about the causes of lung disease
roles:
 research_analyst:
 backstory: Experienced in analyzing scientific data related to respiratory health.
 goal: Analyze data on lung diseases
 role: Research Analyst
 tasks:
 data_analysis:
 description: Gather and analyze data on the causes and risk factors of lung diseases.
 expected_output: Report detailing key findings on lung disease causes.
 tools:
- InternetSearchTool
```

## Step 4: Run the PraisonAI Tool

To run the PraisonAI tool, simply type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
praisonai
```

If you want to run the AG2 framework (Formerly AutoGen), use:

```bash
praisonai --framework autogen
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the `duckduckgo_search` package installed. If not, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install duckduckgo_search
```

That's it! You should now have the PraisonAI tool installed and configured.

## Other information

### TL;DR to Create a Custom Tool

```bash
pip install praisonai duckduckgo-search
export OPENAI_API_KEY="Enter your API key"
praisonai --init research about the latest AI News and prepare a detailed report
```
- Add `- InternetSearchTool` in the agents.yaml file in the tools section.
- Create a file called tools.py and add this code [tools.py](tools.py)

```bash
praisonai
```

### Pre-requisite to Create a Custom Tool

`agents.yaml` file should be present in the current directory.

If it doesn't exist, create it by running the command `praisonai --init research about the latest AI News and prepare a detailed report`.

#### Step 1 to Create a Custom Tool

Create a file called tools.py in the same directory as the agents.yaml file.

```python
# example tools.py

from duckduckgo_search import DDGS
from praisonai_tools import BaseTool

class InternetSearchTool(BaseTool):
 name: str = "InternetSearchTool"
 description: str = "Search Internet for relevant information based on a query or latest news"

 def _run(self, query: str):
 ddgs = DDGS()
 results = ddgs.text(keywords=query, region='wt-wt', safesearch='moderate', max_results=5)
 return results
```

#### Step 2 to Create a Custom Tool

Add the tool to the agents.yaml file as show below under the tools section `- InternetSearchTool`.

```yaml
framework: crewai
topic: research about the latest AI News and prepare a detailed report
roles:
 research_analyst:
 backstory: Experienced in gathering and analyzing data related to AI news trends.
 goal: Analyze AI News trends
 role: Research Analyst
 tasks:
 gather_data:
 description: Conduct in-depth research on the latest AI News trends from reputable
 sources.
 expected_output: Comprehensive report on current AI News trends.
 tools:
- InternetSearchTool
```

# Python Code Custom Tools

For `praisonaiagents` package users, you can create custom tools using the `@tool` decorator or `BaseTool` class.

## Using `@tool` Decorator

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, tool

@tool
def search(query: str) -> str:
 """Search the web for information."""
 return f"Results for: {query}"

@tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> float:
 """Evaluate a math expression."""
 return eval(expression)

agent = Agent(
 instructions="You are a helpful assistant",
 tools=[search, calculate]
)
agent.start("Search for AI news and calculate 15*4")
```

## Using `BaseTool` Class

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, BaseTool

class WeatherTool(BaseTool):
 name = "weather"
 description = "Get current weather for a location"

 def run(self, location: str) -> str:
 return f"Weather in {location}: 72°F, Sunny"

agent = Agent(
 instructions="You are a weather assistant",
 tools=[WeatherTool()]
)
agent.start("What's the weather in Paris?")
```

## Creating a Pip-Installable Tool Package

Create tools that auto-register when installed:

### pyproject.toml

```toml
[project]
name = "my-praisonai-tools"
version = "1.0.0"
dependencies = ["praisonaiagents"]

[project.entry-points."praisonaiagents.tools"]
my_tool = "my_package:MyTool"
```

### my_package/__init__.py

```python
from praisonaiagents import BaseTool

class MyTool(BaseTool):
 name = "my_tool"
 description = "My custom tool"

 def run(self, param: str) -> str:
 return f"Result: {param}"
```

### Usage

After `pip install`, tools are auto-discovered:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

agent = Agent(tools=["my_tool"]) # Works automatically!

```
